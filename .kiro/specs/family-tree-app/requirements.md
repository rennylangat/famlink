# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Family Tree Application is a web-based platform designed to help users create, manage, and visualize their family's ancestry and relationships. The app aims to be intuitive and accessible, addressing the lack of user-friendly family tree tools, especially for African families. It supports personal, commercial SaaS, open-source, and family project use cases. Users can build dynamic family trees, invite relatives to collaborate, and preserve their family history for future generations.
